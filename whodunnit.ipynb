The dimly lit room was adorned with expensive furnishings and a bottle of aged scotch sat prominently on the small mahogany table. But Rupert's mind was far from the comforts of his luxurious surroundings.\n",

As night fell upon the Scottish countryside, the train came alive with a warm, inviting ambience. The gentle hum of the engine and the soft click-clack of the wheels against the tracks created a soothing melody that lulled the weary travelers into a sense of calm.\n",

            "Answer:  Charlie investigates the murder out of self-preservation, as he becomes a prime suspect due to his past connections with Rupert and the scandal.\n",
            "Question: What motive does Alice have to investigate the murder?\n",
            "Answer:  Alice investigates the murder because she believes that her involvement in the fine-dining restaurant car at the time of the crime makes her a potential witness, and she wants to clear her name and find out who really committed the murder.\n",
            "Question: What motive does Donald have to investigate the murder?\n",
