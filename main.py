    This platform is designed to help researchers and users with minimal programming experience create and experiment with
    generative agent-based models (GABMs). Leveraging the Concordia framework, this tool makes it easy to build custom agents,
    explore their attributes, and conduct reliable experiments, all through an accessible and user-friendly interface.
